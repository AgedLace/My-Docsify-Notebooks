Reasoning

1. God's Word is forever settled in heaven; Jesus also said that the Scripture cannot be broken. [John 10:35]. So whatever God has either spoken in heaven, or has recorded in His Written Word, MUST stand. 

2. The whole universe which God created are His servants - they MUST continue to do according to His ordinances.

So in addition to reminding the enemy that he is already defeated, disarmed and on public display, also remind him that not only can God's Word not be altered, but the entire creation, which are His servants, MUST bring about His ordinances so that what has been declared even in the spiritual realm, MUST become manifest in the natural real.  He cannot stop it.  It is signed, sealed and delivered.  So until you see the natural manifestation, continually thank God that it is already a done deal, and keep reminding the enemy of the same.  Refuse to accept anything less.
