> <h5>Isaiah 55:11 ESV</h5>
> 11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

- This is Your spoken word
- It will **not** return to You void / empty
- It **shall** accomplish [NLT says **all**] that You purpose / please / desire
- It **shall** **succeed / prosper** in the thing where You send it
- You **send** Your Word out

I am reminded that You **spoke** all of creation into existence. [Genesis 1]
