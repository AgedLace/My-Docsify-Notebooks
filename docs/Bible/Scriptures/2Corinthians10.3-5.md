"The word is not common in Classical Greek, but occurs frequently in the Apocrypha. In its use here there may lie a reminiscence of the rock-forts on the coast of Paul's native Cilicia, which were pulled down by the Romans in their attacks on the Cilician pirates. Pompey inflicted a crushing defeat upon their navy off the rocky stronghold of Coracesium on the confines of Cilicia and Pisidia" (*WS*, 833).] |

For example, the Gnostics boasted of their "applied knowledge" gained by their personal spiritual experiences – and it was (is) disastrous!<br> <br> *"Gnosticism"* is literally, "the cult based on having special, *personal knowledge*" (1108 /*gnṓsis*)] <br><br>**Strong's Exhaustive Concordance** <br>knowledge, science |
