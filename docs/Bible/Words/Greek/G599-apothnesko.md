> 599 apothnesko (from 575 / apo, "away from," which intensifies 2348 /thnesko, "to die") -- properly, die *off* (away from), focusing on the *sepration* that goes with the "dying *off* (away from)"
>
> 599 /apothnesko ("die off, from") occurs 111 times in the NT.  It stresses *the significance of the separation* that always comes with *divine closure*.  599 (apothnesko) stresses the *ending* of what is "former" -- to bring what (naturally) *follows*.
